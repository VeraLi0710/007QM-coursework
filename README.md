# Optimizing Resource Allocation to Address Childhood Obesity in London  

##  Overview  
This project tackles the pressing issue of **childhood obesity in London** by combining **clustering techniques** and **linear programming** to optimize resource allocation. It's a blend of data science and real-world problem-solving, aiming to make a meaningful impact.  

##  Highlights  
- **Clustering Analysis**: Used K-means to identify high-priority areas for intervention.  
- **Linear Programming**: Designed optimization models to allocate resources effectively.  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provided actionable recommendations based on analysis.  

##  Project Structure  
- **`07 code.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the analysis and modeling.  
- **`QM Written Investigation.pdf`**: The final report detailing the methodology and results.  
- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used for the analysis.  
- **`plots/`**: Visualizations generated during the project.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Linear Programming (scipy.optimize)
